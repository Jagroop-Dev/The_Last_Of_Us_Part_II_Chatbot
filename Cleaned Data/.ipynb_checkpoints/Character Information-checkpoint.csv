After The Beach part where Ellie successfully rescues Abby from the Rattlers, they will face off on the beach.

Ellie wanted to finish what she started by killing Abby, but when she is close to drowning Abby on the beach, she remembers Joel's smile, then lets her and Lev leave the beach.

She wanted to end the cycle of revenge by sparing Abby's life. Because if Abby dies, it is most likely that Lev will take upon getting revenge on Ellie, then someone will avenge Ellie's death and so forth. This might be the reason why Ellie lets her live, before going back to the farm."
