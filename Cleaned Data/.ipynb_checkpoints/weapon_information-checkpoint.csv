The bow is similar to the rifle in that it is great for long ranged combat. However, the key difference is that the bow is silent, so it is much better when your enemies have not yet been alerted of your presence. If you are the type of player who prefers Stealth Kills and picking off enemies slowly and cautiously, the bow will be excellent for you.
You will still need to be smart though, only taking out enemies that are away from their allies, and not currently engaged in conversation. This can allow you to widdle down a group's numbers so that if they do find you, there will be way less enemies to take out.
For bows, landing headshots is vital for two reasons. The first one is the fact that a head shot is s guaranteed kill (However, even if you don't get a head shot, there is still a good chance you will take out human foes and runners in a single shot). The second one is the fact that landing a headshot gives you a chance to get the arrow back, allowing you to conserve ammo!
Unlike other weapons where you find ammo lying around, arrows can be crafted by using the following recipe (which is learned after obtaining the bow automatically):
Not surprisingly though, very slow draw speed and fire rate means that it is not good in close-ranged situations. When an enemy has already spotted you, or enemies are rushing at you, you'll definitely want to switch to something like the Shotgun or Pistol.","

This pistol is really best made use of at short range, so in smaller spaces when accuracy is less of an issue.

When dealing with several enemies at once, such as runners, make sure to stay moving. Although the weapon is great for close range crowd control due to its quick fire rate, you don't want to get surrounded with no ammo in the clip, so place your shots carefully.","The semi-auto pistol is the most basic gun in your arsenal, and the first one you will learn to use.
