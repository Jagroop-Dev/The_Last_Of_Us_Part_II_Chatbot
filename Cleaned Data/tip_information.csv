Combat Guide and Tips,"Environmental Advantage: : Hiding behind obstacles can help you sneak your way closer to unsuspecting enemies for a stealth kill. Take note of the environment before diving into a fight, this way you can avoid taking damage while slowly reducing the enemy numbers or have a place to hide if you ever need to heal yourself., Aim for the head!: : Shooting a target in the head will conserve ammo, and allow you to dispose of threats quicker. Upgrading a weapons stability will make this much easier to nail consistently!, Running Away: : While stealth is usually the best option, in certain situations, you may want to just run away entirely. This is especially true when you are faced with a large group of runners and clickers together. Trying to fight the runners can make it easy for a clicker to one-shot you, so if possible, try and get past them all.How to Run (Sprint), Throwables and Stunning Enemies: : Stunning enemies by throwing a glass bottle or a brick is an effective way to get close to an enemy. Be sure to use them on unsuspecting or approaching enemies as much as you need to., Listen Mode to Locate Enemies: : Using Listen Mode can help you pinpoint the exact location of a nearby enemy and which direction they are facing. Use this to your advantage to take out enemies easier and more effectively. Keep in mind that Listen Mode will also allow you to see the Scent Trail that you left, which can get you into trouble if there is an enemy dog.How to Use Listen Mode, Prone In Tall Grass: : Fighting outside in an open area can make you vulnerable to enemy attacks, especially if you are fighting against a large group. You can hide in the tall grass to prevent the enemies from spotting you this can help you close the gap between enemies and trim down their numbers by killing them stealthily., Use melee attacks when cornered: : When an enemy gets to close to you, trying to pull up your weapon and aim will only lead to them getting a hit in first. When an enemy is coming in for you and they get too close, unleashing your melee attacks (default = □ button) is sometimes the best get-off me option.Keep in mind that this is better for weaker enemies like hunters or runners, and will prove much less effective against clickers., Know your enemy!: : Different enemy types will call for different modes of combat, so be sure and know who youre up against. For example, runners can be taken out in a number of ways, and when many present themselves, it is sometimes best to just take them out with whatever weapons you have in you.Clickers, on the other hand, are completely blind, but if they hear you and are able to get in close, they can one-shot you in an instant. For this enemy, youll usually always want to take the sneaky approach, walking lightly to get near them, then taking them out with a stealth kill., Keep an eye on your health!: : Your health is shown next to your ammo, on the bottom right of the screen. Taking hits from runners and other enemies will deplete your health, so youll need to heal up before it runs out. Using a Health Kit will allow you to restore some HPーbut beware that you are vulnerable while healing! Make sure to get to a safe spot to heal before you can hop back into the action., Increasing Your Accuracy: : You can increase the accuracy of your shots by upgrading the stability of your weapon on the workbench. However, if you want to save yourscavenged partsfor other upgrades, you can try crouching or going prone to increase the accuracy of your shots without having to use scavenged parts.Note:You can further increase your aim using theHold Breathskill from the Precision skill branch., Work Smart, Not Hard!: : There are some situations where you will have to fight against infected enemies and human enemies at the same time. You can use this to your advantage by using a glass bottle or a brick to lure the infected near the humans, which will cause them to fight one another, and significantly trim down their numbers without you having to risk your own life., Being Smart with Human Stealth Kills: : Human enemies tend to communicate with each other when they are hunting for you. Try to take them out when they are alone to reduce the chances of you getting found. If you try to kill an enemy while they are talking to someone, they will immediately figure out that you are close by.Also, human enemies will alert other humans to search the area whenever they see a dead body. Be sure to get away from the body quickly after you execute a Stealth Kill!, Making the Most of your Companion: : Performing a Stealth Kill on an enemy with a companion will automatically cause your companion to perform his/her stealth kill to a nearby enemy. This is an extremely effective when trying to eliminate enemies who are working together.Your companion will also join in combat when you are under attack, so sometimes you might want to play it safe and let them do some of the work for you!, New Routes: : You can break glass windows for new routes and better positioning during combat. However, this can give away your location and draw attention to nearby enemies because of the loud breaking sound.",../Data/Images/tips_images/Combat Guide and Tips.jpg

What is Listen Mode?,"How to Use Listen Mode: : Listen mode can be used by holding the R1 button. Doing this will automatically force you to crouch, and cause you to walk even slower than the normal crouch walk speed. While holding the R1 button down, the screen will become much darker, and nearby enemies will be indicated by a blurry white outline. Note that while in listen mode, you will be unable to draw your weapon or do anything other than move slowly.After using listen mode to look for foes, your next option is up to you. If you spot an enemy, you will typically want to do one of three things:The precise option you go with depends a little bit on your playstyle, as well as the situation you are in. For the most part, Listen Mode is a great tool for executing stealth kills on enemies, since it will let you track the enemys location before it becomes aware of yours. This option lets you eliminate the threat without alerting other enemies and conserving ammo.How to Stealth Kill | Stealth TipsIn other situations, you may opt to simply sneak past the enemy, especially if you are the type of player who just likes to get through an area as quickly as possible without exploring.

The upgrades are as follows:Note: The list of upgrades is still under construction.",../Data/Images/tips_images/What is Listen Mode.jpg
How to Stealth Kill,"Stealth Tips: : For stealth killing to work effecitively, it should come as no surprise that you should avoid having your cover blown. If you stealth kill one enemy right in front of another enemy facing your direction, they will be aware of your presence, which defeats the purpose of using a stealth kill.Here are a few tips to help you make the most of this type of attack., Spot enemies with Listen Mode: : Before going into a room where you suspect enemies are in, hold R1 to enter Listen Mode. This will allow you to detect where each enemy is, and figure out which ones you need to avoid being spotted by.In listen mode, enemies can be spotted as white blurs, which are often moving.How to Use Listen Mode, Sneak up behind enemies while crouched: : Crouching will make you very slow, but also extremely quiet when compared to walking normally. On the other hand, holding L1 and sprinting lets you go fast, but you will be heard by your enemies. When you want to stealth kill your enemies, approach them from behind after pressing the crouch button (○) so that they dont hear you coming up from behind.For some enemies, like runners, simply moving while crouched is enough to catch them by surprise. Clickers have a better sense of heating, so you will have to sneak up on them by lightly holding the stick forward., Hide behind obstacles when approaching: : In addition to crouching, using obstacles such as cars, furniture, or anything else lying around, is a great way to get the upper hand on your foes. Since foes are normally moving, staying close to and looping around these objects can keep you from getting spotted., Target moving enemies first: : When there are multiple enemies in the same vicinity, the order you stealth kill them in is very important. Usually, your enemies will be moving, but some of them (such as when fighting multiple infected) will remain still. Watch their movements, and base the order you will attack in appropriately.As a rule of thumb, save the enemies who seem to not move for last. The moving enemies are the ones you should aim for first, since getting them out of the way will allow you to easily take out the remaining enemies., Look for movement patterns: : When dealing with several enemies that move around, be sure and observe them for a bit before rushing in for the kill. Most moving enemies follow a pattern, so watching them allows you to pick up on this and wait for the best opportunity to strike, or stealth kill another enemy once they are at a distance where they wont spot you., Benefits of Stealth Killing: , Conserve Ammo: : The most obvious benefit to stealth killing is that it allows you to take out an enemy without using up any ammo. Ammo can be scarce (especially on higher difficulties), so rather than using it recklessly, you can save it for when you need it and take care of unalerted enemies without wasting resources.An important point about stealth killing is thatit will not cause you to lose your shiv, unlike the first Last of Us where stealth skills could only be done if you had a shiv made in advance (which had a limited number of uses, and meant that simply running past enemies was often the best option). In TLoU2, you dont need to worry about shivs breaking, so feel free to stealth kill every enemy you can!, Easy Kills: : While sneaking up on an opponent and taking them up certainly requires an element of strategy, it will allow you to avoid combat, where you could potentially take damage or even die. Unless you just prefer to play by shooting down everything in your path (which, given the lack of ammo, is not always possible), sneak kills are the simple way to take out enemies blocking your path.Of course, there are times when Stealth Kills will not be ideal, or even possible. Once an enemy is aware of your presence, stealth killing is no longer an option, and youll have to instead deal with them the old fashioned way (via combat).",../Data/Images/tips_images/How to Stealth Kill.jpg
