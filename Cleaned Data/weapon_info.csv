With its small magazine (default = 3), you should not really be trying to take out entire crowds with it. It is most effective against human enemies that won't try and rush you, or perhaps single enemies when you have a clean shot on them.
While the rifle can work at a medium range if there are not too many foes, you should normally just opt for the revolver instead, since it can hold more bullets, and it has a better fire rate.","The rifle is a high damaging but very slow weapon, so generally you'll be using it from a distance to pick off foes.

Bottle,No upgrades for this weapon,"Bottles are generally used fordistracting or misdirecting infected and human enemies. They can be thrown on the ground to create noise or break glass windows to open up new routes. This can cause enemies to group up on that area where you can easily sneak by them or kill them all at once using the tools you crafted. However, if you are playing more aggressively, you can alsothrow them directly to the enemy's head and stun themfor a few seconds.

Keep in mind that they canwork on hidden traps too!You can throw them on the tripwire or the claymore itself to trigger the traps without taking damage.","Bottles can sometimes be found lying around on the ground, so pick it up if you see one.

The bow is similar to the rifle in that it is great for long ranged combat. However, the key difference is that the bow is silent, so it is much better when your enemies have not yet been alerted of your presence. If you are the type of player who prefers Stealth Kills and picking off enemies slowly and cautiously, the bow will be excellent for you.
You will still need to be smart though, only taking out enemies that are away from their allies, and not currently engaged in conversation. This can allow you to widdle down a group's numbers so that if they do find you, there will be way less enemies to take out.
For bows, landing headshots is vital for two reasons. The first one is the fact that a head shot is s guaranteed kill (However, even if you don't get a head shot, there is still a good chance you will take out human foes and runners in a single shot). The second one is the fact that landing a headshot gives you a chance to get the arrow back, allowing you to conserve ammo!
Unlike other weapons where you find ammo lying around, arrows can be crafted by using the following recipe (which is learned after obtaining the bow automatically):
Not surprisingly though, very slow draw speed and fire rate means that it is not good in close-ranged situations. When an enemy has already spotted you, or enemies are rushing at you, you'll definitely want to switch to something like the Shotgun or Pistol.","

Flamethrower,No upgrades for this weapon,"The Flamethrower is one of the best weapons you can get in the game. This weapon is best used against the infected, since they are more vulnerable to fire.

This pistol is really best made use of at short range, so in smaller spaces when accuracy is less of an issue. One trick for conserving ammo, which will work against most enemies is to shoot them in the leg to stun them, and then run in to follow up with a melee attack than can finish them off.

However, crafting a Pipe Bomb automatically gives you two of them, which makes up for the extra materials it needs.
It is recommended that you craft and use pipe bombs whenever possible, as it is your main tool for clearing multiple enemies (especially since Abby doesn't have access to Molotovs.)
