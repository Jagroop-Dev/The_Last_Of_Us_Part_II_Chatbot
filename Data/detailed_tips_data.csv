It can be executed by first getting very close behind an enemy without being detected, then grabbing them and finishing them off with a stealth kill. Unlike guns, which will draw attention from other enemies and expose your location, stealth kills are quiet, allowing you to strategically take out enemies one by one.\nAfter getting behind an enemy, press the △ button to grab them.

When you want to stealth kill your enemies, approach them from behind after pressing the crouch button (○) so that they don't hear you coming up from behind.\nFor some enemies, like runners, simply moving while crouched is enough to catch them by surprise. Clickers have a better sense of heating, so you will have to sneak up on them by lightly holding the stick forward.""}, 'Hide behind obstacles when approaching': {'paragraphs': 'In addition to crouching, using obstacles such as cars, furniture, or anything else lying around, is a great way to get the upper hand on your foes. Since foes are normally moving, staying close to and looping around these objects can keep you from getting spotted.'}, 'Target moving enemies first': {'paragraphs': 'When there are multiple enemies in the same vicinity, the order you stealth kill them in is very important. Usually, your enemies will be moving, but some of them (such as when fighting multiple infected) will remain still. Watch their movements, and base the order you will attack in appropriately.\nAs a rule of thumb, save the enemies who seem to not move for last.

Ammo can be scarce (especially on higher difficulties), so rather than using it recklessly, you can save it for when you need it and take care of unalerted enemies without wasting resources.\nAn important point about stealth killing is thatit will not cause you to lose your shiv, unlike the first Last of Us where stealth skills could only be done if you had a shiv made in advance (which had a limited number of uses, and meant that simply running past enemies was often the best option).
