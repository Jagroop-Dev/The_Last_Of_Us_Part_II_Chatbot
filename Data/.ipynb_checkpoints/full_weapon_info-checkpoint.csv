Due to its high fire rate, it is great in scenarios where enemies like runners are rushing toward you. It will not deal as much damage as some of the other weapons, so landing headshots is extremely important, as it will take several shots to take down foes with it otherwise.
This pistol is really best made use of at short range, so in smaller spaces when accuracy is less of an issue. One trick for conserving ammo, which will work against most enemies is to shoot them in the leg to stun them, and then run in to follow up with a melee attack than can finish them off. Clickers will be hard to take down with this gun alone, so a shot in the head or legs to stun them is the best tactic to deal with them.
When dealing with several enemies at once, such as runners, make sure to stay moving. Although the weapon is great for close range crowd control due to its quick fire rate, you don't want to get surrounded with no ammo in the clip, so place your shots carefully.","Obtained by default

However, this gun does pack a punch, and after upgrading the damage output, it can usually one-shot runners and hunters, even if you do not shoot them in the head.
Generally, it is good for smaller crowds, and since it is more accurate than the pistol, it is better at a medium range. It is very effective on human foes, since they are less likely to rush at you, and as mentioned above, they can be one-shotted even without head shots. For battling hordes of charging runners, the pistol will usually be a safer option due to its quicker fire rate.","

However, its powerful damage makes up for these drawbacks. The Hunting Pistol packs a strong punch with every shot, especially in mid to close-range fights.
The Hunting Pistol is best used when taking out solo targets because of its exceptional damage. Because of this, it can take out most enemies with one shot, even without aiming at their weak points.","Found in a Safe

With its small magazine (default = 3), you should not really be trying to take out entire crowds with it. It is most effective against human enemies that won't try and rush you, or perhaps single enemies when you have a clean shot on them.
While the rifle can work at a medium range if there are not too many foes, you should normally just opt for the revolver instead, since it can hold more bullets, and it has a better fire rate.","Obtained by default

It sacrifices accuracy for the ability to spread over a wide range, which means it can hit multiple enemies that are up close and bunched up together.
This weapon is good against pretty much any enemy at close range. Runners are guaranteed to fall, and it is super effective against human enemies too. Clickers have larger health pools, so they may not die when hit, but they will almost always be stunned, allowing you to run in and hit them with a melee attack.","Obtain from the Bank Vault in Downtown Seattle

Bow,https://game8.co/games/Last-of-Us-2/archives/290748,"[{'Weapon': 'Long-range bow with silent shots and slow draw speed.'}, {'Weapon': 'Long Gun'}, {'Weapon': '6'}]","[{'Name': 'Draw Speed', 'Parts': '50', 'Effect': 'Restring the bow to increase draw speed.+50% Nocking Speed+70% Draw Speed'}, {'Name': 'Stability', 'Parts': '60', 'Effect': 'Replace the grip to decrease weapon sway.+60% Stability'}, {'Name': 'Rangefinder', 'Parts': '80', 'Effect': 'Add a rangefinder to automatically mark the distance of enemies on the reticle.'}]","
The bow is similar to the rifle in that it is great for long ranged combat. However, the key difference is that the bow is silent, so it is much better when your enemies have not yet been alerted of your presence. If you are the type of player who prefers Stealth Kills and picking off enemies slowly and cautiously, the bow will be excellent for you.
You will still need to be smart though, only taking out enemies that are away from their allies, and not currently engaged in conversation. This can allow you to widdle down a group's numbers so that if they do find you, there will be way less enemies to take out.
For bows, landing headshots is vital for two reasons. The first one is the fact that a head shot is s guaranteed kill (However, even if you don't get a head shot, there is still a good chance you will take out human foes and runners in a single shot). The second one is the fact that landing a headshot gives you a chance to get the arrow back, allowing you to conserve ammo!
Unlike other weapons where you find ammo lying around, arrows can be crafted by using the following recipe (which is learned after obtaining the bow automatically):
Not surprisingly though, very slow draw speed and fire rate means that it is not good in close-ranged situations. When an enemy has already spotted you, or enemies are rushing at you, you'll definitely want to switch to something like the Shotgun or Pistol.","Obtained automatically

It works well in mid to long-range combat, and can one-shot most enemies if you aim for the head. The Semi-Auto Rifle works well on any type of enemy, both infected and human because of its high damage and amazing fire rate. The only downside of this weapon is its loud firing sound.
The loud firing sound of your shots can give away your position, so use it on situations where you have a clear view of the incoming enemies. This way you can pick them off before they can even get close enough to attack you.","Obtained Automatically

Use the Crossbow in mid to long-range combat, especially if you are still hidden. Crossbows are silent and they won't attract enemy attention when fired. Use this to your advantage to pick off enemies at a distance without getting seen.
Also, landing your arrows at the head guarantees that the arrow won't break after being shot. This will allow you to conserve your ammo by picking them up after taking out an enemy.","Found in Seattle Day 1 - The Coast

You can heal yourself by holding on to the R2 button after selecting the Health Kit using your D-Pad. Healing will let you recover a large portion of your health which can be seen on the lower right side of the screen.
However, using a health kit takes a few seconds, so be sure to wait until you are in a safe area to do it!
