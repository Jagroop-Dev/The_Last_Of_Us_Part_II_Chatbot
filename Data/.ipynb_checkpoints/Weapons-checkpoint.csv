Due to its high fire rate, it is great in scenarios where enemies like runners are rushing toward you. It will not deal as much damage as some of the other weapons, so landing headshots is extremely important, as it will take several shots to take down foes with it otherwise.
This pistol is really best made use of at short range, so in smaller spaces when accuracy is less of an issue. One trick for conserving ammo, which will work against most enemies is to shoot them in the leg to stun them, and then run in to follow up with a melee attack than can finish them off. Clickers will be hard to take down with this gun alone, so a shot in the head or legs to stun them is the best tactic to deal with them.
When dealing with several enemies at once, such as runners, make sure to stay moving. Although the weapon is great for close range crowd control due to its quick fire rate, you don't want to get surrounded with no ammo in the clip, so place your shots carefully.","The semi-auto pistol is the most basic gun in your arsenal, and the first one you will learn to use.

However, this gun does pack a punch, and after upgrading the damage output, it can usually one-shot runners and hunters, even if you do not shoot them in the head.
Generally, it is good for smaller crowds, and since it is more accurate than the pistol, it is better at a medium range. It is very effective on human foes, since they are less likely to rush at you, and as mentioned above, they can be one-shotted even without head shots. For battling hordes of charging runners, the pistol will usually be a safer option due to its quicker fire rate.","While headshots are important for any gun you use, this is especially true for the revolver, due to its low fire rate.

With its small magazine (default = 3), you should not really be trying to take out entire crowds with it. It is most effective against human enemies that won't try and rush you, or perhaps single enemies when you have a clean shot on them.
While the rifle can work at a medium range if there are not too many foes, you should normally just opt for the revolver instead, since it can hold more bullets, and it has a better fire rate.","The rifle is a high damaging but very slow weapon, so generally you'll be using it from a distance to pick off foes.

It sacrifices accuracy for the ability to spread over a wide range, which means it can hit multiple enemies that are up close and bunched up together.
This weapon is good against pretty much any enemy at close range. Runners are guaranteed to fall, and it is super effective against human enemies too. Clickers have larger health pools, so they may not die when hit, but they will almost always be stunned, allowing you to run in and hit them with a melee attack.","As mentioned above, the pump shotgun is a high powered close range gun.

The bow is similar to the rifle in that it is great for long ranged combat. However, the key difference is that the bow is silent, so it is much better when your enemies have not yet been alerted of your presence. If you are the type of player who prefers Stealth Kills and picking off enemies slowly and cautiously, the bow will be excellent for you.
You will still need to be smart though, only taking out enemies that are away from their allies, and not currently engaged in conversation. This can allow you to widdle down a group's numbers so that if they do find you, there will be way less enemies to take out.
For bows, landing headshots is vital for two reasons. The first one is the fact that a head shot is s guaranteed kill (However, even if you don't get a head shot, there is still a good chance you will take out human foes and runners in a single shot). The second one is the fact that landing a headshot gives you a chance to get the arrow back, allowing you to conserve ammo!
Unlike other weapons where you find ammo lying around, arrows can be crafted by using the following recipe (which is learned after obtaining the bow automatically):
Not surprisingly though, very slow draw speed and fire rate means that it is not good in close-ranged situations. When an enemy has already spotted you, or enemies are rushing at you, you'll definitely want to switch to something like the Shotgun or Pistol.","
